//BCTrap.h: Trap system
// Â©2020-2021 DrewCrawfordApps LLC

/*
 Support for error handling on platforms vary widely.  On CPU platforms, we generally like trap behavior if input is very invalid, ideally with robust debugging information.  However even bare aborts are not supported in Metal, and in some of our attempts to create it we discover compiler bugs.
 
 Moreover, there is some concern about the speed vs safety of various error mechanisms.  Speed in particular varies widely across platforms, while the expected API may vary across programming environments.
 
 As such, we implement a semantic error system.  blitcurve defines a set of macros for each semantic error type, that may be customized on a per-platform basis.
 
 Generally, semantic assertions contain
 * a type (e.g. assert, precondition, etc.) This is analagous to log levels in logging systems and allow different assertions to be handled differently.
 * a condition (like a classic assert statement).  If the condition is false we do the error handling
 * an rvalue.  For cases where trap is not available, we return this value.  This may be an error code or some "reserved" value in the domain of the function, depending on the function documentation.
 
 Then a platform can customize the assert behavior, per-type.  For each type,
 
 * The platform might trap, if supported / convenient.  On Metal we have tried a variety of trap systems, not all of which work well.  At the time of this writing, we trap on CPU platforms, but this may change.
 * If not trapping, the rvalue may be returned.
 * We may in the future allow a mode for UB for errors, to allow faster performance.  Unclear to me if this will be in the form of calling special UB functions, or through a preprocessor define.
 
 Assertion types.  These generally draw a distinction between "variant" and "constant" values.  Constant values are parameters that the developer probably used a compile-time constant for (e.g. a strategy, max size, accuracy, etc.)  Variant values are those that really reflect the runtime situation (geometry, etc.)  In this way we can check assertions for the former case during development and then disable them, knowing that the same constants are in use in production and they were fine.
 
 0.  BUGASSERT.  Checking blitcurve behavior itself.
 1.  ASSERT.  Common errors developers make when calling blitcurve functions, such as unsupported strategies.  Generally this ought to be used for cases that are invariant (e.g., developer is probably passing a constant argument).
 2.  RANGEASSERT.  Errors when variant data are outside a (probably) constant range.  e.g., bezier parameters outside of range 0<=t<=1, or a paramater out of range of another parameter which is likely known at compile time.
 2.  PRECONDITION.  Less common errors.  Most often, involving the relationship between two non-constant variables
